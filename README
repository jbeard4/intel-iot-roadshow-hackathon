This project provides a visual morse code parser, which can be used as a learning tool for people interested in morse code.

The parser implemented using an SCXML state machine. The state machine accepts input from Edison button sensors, parses the input, and outputs a message to the LCD RGB backlight. Additionally, the Edison is able to post the message to twitter. This demonstrates how SCXML can be used as a rich language for processing IoT sensor events.
